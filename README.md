## `sp lgtm`

Generates a few multiple-choice questions about a range of commits and asks
them, in your terminal. The questions are about what the change *does* — what a
new guard prevents, what the error path now returns, which edit can touch
existing rows — never about statistics, naming, or formatting.

```sh
sp lgtm                       # what this branch adds since it left main
sp lgtm main...feature/x      # someone else's branch, before you merge it
sp lgtm -n 3 -d hard
sp lgtm --dry-run             # what it would ask about, no model call
```

Needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Generation is three sequential model calls, so expect
it to take a moment — this is a thing you run before a merge, not on every
commit.

### It is a self-check, not a gate

`sp lgtm` has no way to stop you doing anything. The answers live in the same
process as the questions, on your machine, and you can skip the whole thing.
That is on purpose: the version that actually gates is the
[GitHub Action](https://github.com/sparepartslabs/spareparts-lgtm), which asks
the *reviewer* after they approve and holds a check run open until they answer.

What local gets in exchange is the thing the Action can't have: the code is
checked out. Press `?` on any question to print the hunk it came from. Wrong
answers are never a failure — you get told which files to look at again, and it
re-asks, as many times as you like.

### Configuration

Reads `.github/lgtm.yml` from the repo you're in, the same file the Action uses,
so a repo is configured once:

```yaml
questions: 2          # 1-5
difficulty: medium    # easy | medium | hard
exemptPaths:
  - "docs/**"
```

Keys that only mean something to the Action (`enforce`, `webConcepts`,
`surfaceReading`, `answerQuestions`, `exemptReviewers`) are accepted and
ignored. `-n` and `-d` override the file.

Lockfiles, `dist/`, `vendor/`, `*.pbxproj` and friends are never quizzed.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Confirmed |
| 1 | Not confirmed — wrong answers, or you quit |
| 2 | Couldn't ask — no API key, git failed, nothing quizzable |

If you wire this into a git hook, treat only `1` as a failure. A tool that
cannot run must not block a commit.

## Development

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
```

`lgtm`'s diff parsing, config, screening and generator are a port of the
TypeScript in
[`spareparts-lgtm`](https://github.com/sparepartslabs/spareparts-lgtm). The
prompts in `generator.py` are the part worth keeping identical — changing the
wording here without changing it there produces two tools that disagree about
the same diff.
